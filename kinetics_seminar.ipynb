        "So far, we've focused on how temperature affects reaction rates through the Arrhenius equation and energy barriers. However, other factors can also significantly influence reaction kinetics by changing the stability of different states (reactant, product, and transition state).\n",
        "\n",
        "One common factor used in protein folding studies is **chemical denaturant** (like urea or guanidine hydrochloride). Denaturants destabilize the folded state relative to the unfolded state, and can also affect the stability of the transition state.\n",
        "\n",
        "By measuring reaction rates (like folding and unfolding rates) at different denaturant concentrations, we can gain insight into how the stability of the transition state is coupled to the folding/unfolding process. This leads us to the **Chevron plot**, which analyzes how folding and unfolding rates change with denaturant concentration.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of our multi-state systems, folding and unfolding can often be viewed as **competing pathways** (parallel barriers). The observed rate is the sum of the rates of these competing processes. A Chevron plot helps visualize how the dominance shifts between folding and unfolding as the denaturant concentration changes, revealing information about the energy landscape and the position of the transition state along the reaction coordinate.\n",
