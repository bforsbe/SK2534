    "# Classroom Challenge: *Design Your Own Water Model*\n",
    "\n",
    "Water is the most important molecule in biochemistry. Yet in molecular simulations, we cannot represent it with all its quantum complexity ‚Äî we need to **simplify** it into a classical ‚Äúmodel‚Äù that computers can handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is: a computer program simulating the motions of water molecules must be given an idea about **what each water molecule looks like**, **what interactions to calculate**, and **the quantities needed to calculate those interactions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, your group‚Äôs challenge is to invent your own **water model**: a simplified representation of a water molecule for simulations. You‚Äôll need to decide:\n",
    "- How many interaction sites (atoms or dummy points) will it have?\n",
    "- Where do you place charges?\n",
    "- Do you include Lennard‚ÄìJones (LJ) interactions, and on which sites?\n",
    "- Will you aim for **speed** (simpler, fewer sites) or for **accuracy** (more parameters, more realistic)?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, you‚Äôll present your model, explain your reasoning, and we‚Äôll compare it to real models scientists use (SPC, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP5P).\n"

    "## Example: A ‚ÄúToo Simple‚Äù Water Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we try to make water as simple as possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geometry**: One sphere (just the oxygen atom).\n",
    "- **Charges**: One negative charge at the center.\n",
    "- **LJ terms**: Sphere has van der Waals radius and attraction.\n",
    "- **Hydrogens?** Ignored completely!\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ This is essentially a **1-site water model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit**:\n",
    "- Extremely fast to simulate (only one particle per water molecule).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drawback**:\n",
    "- Completely unrealistic: no hydrogen atoms means no hydrogen bonding, no dipole moment, and no correct liquid structure.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Sketch your water model.** Decide how many sites, where charges go, and what LJ terms you include.\n",
    "2. **Justify your choices.** Why this geometry? Why these charges?\n",
    "3. **Think about tradeoffs.** Is your model fast but inaccurate, or slower but more realistic?\n",
    "4. **Prepare a 5-minute presentation.** Your group should be ready to explain and defend your model.\n"

    "- Real water has O‚ÄìH bond length ‚âà 1 √Ö and H‚ÄìO‚ÄìH angle ‚âà 104‚Äì109¬∞.\n",
    "- Water‚Äôs dipole moment is ~1.85 Debye in reality, but many simulation models use a bit larger (~2.2‚Äì2.5 D) to reproduce liquid properties.\n",
    "- Lennard‚ÄìJones (LJ) interactions usually go on oxygen atoms, not hydrogens.\n",
    "- More sites = more realism, but also more computation.\n"
