The hydrophobic core of a protein is designed to exclude water, which is necessary for proton transfer reactions. If a titratable residue is buried, its access to solvent is restricted, severely slowing down the rate at which it can gain or lose a proton. This means that buried charged residues can have their protonation states effectively **kinetically trapped**. Their protonation state might reflect the pH of the environment when the protein folded, and it may take a very long time (hours, days, or even weeks) for it to adjust to a change in the surrounding pH.
